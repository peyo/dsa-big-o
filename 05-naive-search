What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}

  Linear - O(n)
  The algorithm needs to search through the values of an array one by one. The time and space increase linearly with the array's length.
