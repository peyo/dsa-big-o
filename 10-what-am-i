10. What Am I?
What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isWhat(n) {
    if (n < 2 || n % 1 !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        if (n % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

  Linear - O(n)
  The algorithm determines if n is greater than 2, is an integer, and is a prime number. The for loop will count up to n to see if n / i has a remainder. The counting will take longer with a larger n. If n = 5, the algorithm will count from 2 to 4. If n = 41, the algorithm will count from 2 to 40.
