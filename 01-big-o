1)  Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people.You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed.So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog.You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a play date for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

  Constant - O(1)
  It doesn't matter how many people there are. All one has to do is yell out once to find a pair for one's dog.

2)  Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people.You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed.So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog.You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever.He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

  Linear - O(n)
  One has to visit each person once. The number of visits increases linearly as the number of people increases.
