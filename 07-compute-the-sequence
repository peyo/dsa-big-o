What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i === 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

  Linear - O(n)
  The algorithm counts up the number that is inputted into the function one by one. Larger the number, the time and space required will increase linearly.
